# CS3012--GithubAPI

When a username is entered, basic information is given about the user, such as their name and the amount of followers they have. A prompt will then ask the user if they would like to see the details about the languages that the github user used. If they answer 'y', a list of languages will be given followed by the amount of repositories containing that language. A bar chart will then display this information.
